Computerized Human Language Acquisition System
==============================


This software is currently NON-FREE Software.  Thise is private software.  If you have received this somehow and are not in direct contact with me, Zach Bornheimer, contact me immediately.
Because of the implications of this system, it must remain non-free until I can determine how to best release it and minimize the dangerous aspects of it.

If you code in Perl6, PLEASE follow the style Zysys Perl6 Style Guide <http://zysys.org/wiki/index.php/Perl6_Style_Guide> and don't hesitate to look at the style of nlp.pl6 if you want to see how the style is implemented.

Main Program:
nlp.pl6

Documentation:
[all coming soon]
Provisional Patent Application with English Explainations of the System Details
Flowcharts illustrating the steps

Submodules:
[all coming soon]
Zedram
nlp-corpus

Future Implementation
=====================

The goal will be to write each feature in modules that way they can be called simply.
The creation of an OO interface for this will be a beautiful thing :O)
