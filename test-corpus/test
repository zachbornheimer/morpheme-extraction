"The frail little mother of a frail little daughter" did not live long enough to see the fullest answer to her prayer that her youngest born might "grow up to be a good and useful woman," for she passed away before her daughter began her medical career, but the prayer was not forgotten by Him who ever hears the cry of those who call upon Him in faith.  Clara was the youngest of the ten children of John and Clarissa Seavey Swain. She was born in Elmira, N.Y., but when she was two years old her parents returned to their old home in Castile and here she spent her early life.
